=TITLE Documentation on gather-js-jq plugin for Collection

=DESCRIPTION Looks for C<js-script>/C<js-link> & C<jquery>/<jquery-link> key in other plugins.
Creates template entries that are referenced in the generic source-wrap template.

=head1 Usage

Other C<render> plugins will provide custom javascript (aka ECMA) or C<JQuery> files to be served with an html page.
This plugin takes those files/links and deals with them so that they can be served with the HTML in the
content files. This requires modification of the templates, and js files in the plugin directory
will need to be copied to the correct
output directory.

In addition, the order in which JS / ECMA libraries are loaded may be important, e.g., leaflet-providers.js must
load after the leaflet library. This is enabled by supplying an ordering parameter.
The default ordering is 0. So
any ordering a number greater than 0 will go after all 0-order files.

For example, within the C<config.raku> of the C<LeafletMap> plugin, we have
=begin code

    :js-link(q:to/JS/),
        src="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.8.0/dist/leaflet.js"
        integrity="sha512-BB3hKbKWOc9Ez/TAwyWxNXeoV9c1v6FIeYiBieIWkpLjauysF18NzgR1MBNBXf8/KABdlkX68nAhlwcDFLGPCQ=="
        crossorigin=""
        JS
    :js-script(['leaflet-providers.js',1],),
=end code

The Array has the name of a local (see below) js file that has an ordering parameter of 1.

Multiple JS/JQ entries are possible by listing each item. A list as the first item is ambiguous because it
could be either a duplet with an order parameter, or a list of items. The ambiguity is resolved by looking at the
second element.

=head2 Local javascript files

The C<js-script> key in the other plugin's config file is assumed to be a filename containing text that is to be
copied into the C<destination> folder.

This plugin copies all script files to the appropriate
sub-directory of the destination directory, and configures the templates to serve them.

The C< <script> ... </script> > tags will be added by the plugin.

=head2 Remote javascript

The C<js-link> key in the other plugin's config file is taken to be the URL of the remote source. The plugin
configures the templates to access the source.

When a C<js-link> (or C<jquery-link>) is given in the config, the whole of the string is included inside
C< <script ... > >, so it is necessary to provide the C<src="..."> as well. This is to allow for a link
string to have other attributes, such as cross-origin and integrity.

=head2 Local JQuery

The C<jquery> key in the other plugin's config file is assumed to be the filename of the local source.
See local javascript files.

=head2 Remote JQuery

The C<jquery-link> key in the other plugin's config file is assumed to be the URL to a JQuery source.

If any C<jquery> or C<jquery-link> key is found, then this plugin will load the
jquery lib specified in the config file for this plugin. (If another plugin requires a different, e.g. later,
version of JQuery, then the config for this plugin must be updated manually).

=head2 Bottom

If there is any reason to put a script at the bottom of the page, then use the key C<js-bottom>. This
is assumed only to apply to local JS scripts because
=item A script link need only be at the top.
=item A JQuery plugin can be loaded before the DOM is loaded but activated only afterwards.
