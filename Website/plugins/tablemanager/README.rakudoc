=TITLE tablemanager is a plugin for Collection
=SUBTITLE The plugin exposes the tablemanger JQuery plugin

The plugin adds a namespace at the render stage, but it expects data to be
made available during the render stage and for it to be used during the compilation
stage.

It is important and assumed that C<tablemanager> comes before the plugin generating the data in the
plugins required list for the render milestone. When C<tablemanager> plugin is encountered, its name-space
is also established. The namespace is used by the data-providing plugin.

Credit is due to L<Pietr Antonio | https://www.jqueryscript.net/plus/search.php?keyword=pietrantonio91 >
for the JQuery code.

The data should be in form of a hash, with keys to be accessed using the metadata key C<data>,
see Custom blocks.

Within the C<tablemanager> namespace, the dataset key will point to the data structure as follows:

The structure is required to be an array:
=item first (zeroth) element is an array of strings that will be used as the headers
=item2 An empty string can be used to create an empty header.
=item2 It is assumed there will always be a header row.
=item2 Only one header row is assumed.
=item subsequent elements will be data in rows.
=item it is required there is at least one data row.
=item if more data is in a row than in a header, it will be ignored
=item if less data is in a row than in a header, empty cell(s) will be added to the row

=head1 TableManager options

TableManager has several option, which are explained at L<JQuery explanation | https://www.jqueryscript.net/table/pagination-sort-filter-manager.html>.

The following are implemented here:
=item firstSort
=item disable
=item appendFilterby
=item pagination
=item showrows
=item disableFilterBy

=head1 Custom blocks

The block is C< =tablemanager> and requires the meta data C<:data>, e.g.
=begin code
    =for TableManager :data<routines>
    = firstSort('[[2,0]]')
    = disable('["last"]')
    = appendFilterby('true')
    = vocabulary
    = pagination('true')
    = showrows('[10,20,30,50]')
    = disableFilterBy('[4]')
    Text that will be used in the table caption
=end code

=head1 Improvements

=item Only one table per data-set per page is assumed.
=item2 Multiple tables each for a differently named dataset are possible on one page
=item2 If more than one table for a single dataset is needed, then plugin will need to be enhanced.
=item2 Easy fix would be to allow user to specify ID in the block meta data.
