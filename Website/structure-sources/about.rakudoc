=TITLE About the docs.raku.org website

The B<Raku programming language> is a very flexible, modern programming language.

This website is dedicated to be a good I<viewer> for its documentation.
Many people have contributed to writing the documentation and tooling, and a separate credits page
can be found L<here|https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Raku/doc/master/CREDITS>.

This particular website is a fraction of effort standing on the shoulders of the giants.

Some of the people who helped create this I< website > are:
=item L<Ogden Webb | https://github.com/ogdenwebb > - the author of the website design.
=item L<Aleks-Daniel Jakimenko-Aleksejev | https://github.com/AlexDaniel> - provided invaluable feedback.

=item L<Juan Julián Merelo Guervós | https://github.com/JJ> - led work on Raku documentation and refactored
resulting in L<Documentable| https://github.com/Raku/Documentable> creation.

=item L<Richard Nabil Hainsworth, aka finanalyst | https://github.com/finanalyst> - adapted website to Collection toolchain.
