    Following in the steps of other open source projects that
    eventually take over the world, here is the partial list
    of people who have contributed to this documentation.
    It is sorted by name and formatted to allow easy
    grepping and beautification by scripts.
    The fields are: name (N), email (E), web-address (W),
    description (D), GitHub username (U) and snail-mail
    address (S).

        Thanks,

        The Raku/doc Team
        PS: Yes, this looks remarkably like the Linux CREDITS format
        PPS: This file is encoded in UTF-8
